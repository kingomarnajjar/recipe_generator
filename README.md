Recipe Generator
10th August 2017

BRIEF
In groups of 3 to 4 you will produce a Ruby terminal application for your lead trainer. You can build something to entertain them, to surprise them, to solve a problem or make them think.

PROBLEM
What should we cook tonight?
Not knowing the carbon footprints of our food choices
For everyone who cooks at home, 4pm is a difficult time. The dreaded question ‘What shall we make/have for dinner tonight?’ inevitably shows its head. What we wanted to create was a recipe generator using online recipes; the user would input ingredients that they have at home and the programme would suggest three recipes that they can make with them, the user would then select their desired recipe and the programme would give them a full list of ingredients they still need to buy and the method as well.
Demographic: people who cook at home 20+ years

DEVELOPMENTS
SPLITTING UP THE WORK
The workload was split into four different section: API, backup programme, carbon converter & output graph/images. After having come up with the concept, we worked separately for most of the first day to push our sections as far as we could. We then regrouped to figure out how best to incorporate all the elements together.

API
The API we found ran the search of ingredients for recipes much more efficiently than our current web scraping ruby programme. We decided that we needed to push the apps function a bit further. This is when we decided to put a carbon calculator onto the app as well. Now when the user gets given the three choices they can make a more informed decision on recipe.

Two parallel projects
So as not to be left without a working project at all, we decided it best to run two parallel projects, “API dependent” & “Web Scraping dependent”, just in case we could not get the API working properly.
